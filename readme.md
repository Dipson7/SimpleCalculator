## Introduction
<p>
This calculator was made using tkinter in pycharm and it can perform simple mathematical operations. 
</p>

## Features 
<p>
-A various buttons have been assigned to input desired numbers and mathematical symbols.<br> 
-It can perform simple mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.<br>
-We can also perform modulus division and exponent.<br> 
-Consists of reset button to clear all the inputs/outputs in the entry box. <br>
-Consists of equals to button to display result. <br>
-The output in entry box can be used again to perform further calculations. <br>
</p>

## Conclusion <br>
<p>
This calculator can be further improved in both functioning and designing. More mathematical symbols can be added to perform more operations. Variables button can be added to perform algebraic calculations. More functions can be added to perform log arithmetic, trigonometric and many more mathematical operations.  <br>
